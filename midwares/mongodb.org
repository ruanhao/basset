* CRUD 概念

** [[https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sql-comparison/][SQL to MongoDB Mapping]]



** [[https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/write-concern/][Write Concern]]

Write concern (Write Acknowledgement) describes the *level of acknowledgment*.

** Read Concern

Read concern (Read Isolation) controls the consistency and isolation of the data read from replica sets and replica set shards.

*** available

For unsharded collections (including collections in a standalone deployment or a replica set deployment),
=local= and =available= read concerns behave *identically*.




*** linearizable

"Linearizable" read concern was introduced in MongoDb 3.4 to solve a possible issue with "majority" Read concern.

See [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42615319/the-difference-between-majority-and-linearizable][The difference between "majority" and "linearizable"]]



* Replica Set

A replica set contains several _data bearing nodes_ and optionally one _arbiter node_ (only used to vote). \\
Of the data bearing nodes, *one and only one member is deemed the primary node, while the other nodes are deemed secondary nodes.*

MongoDB applies write operations on the primary and then records the operations on the primary’s _oplog_. \\
Secondary members *replicate this log* and apply the operations to their data sets.

#+HTML: <img src="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/_images/replica-set-read-write-operations-primary.bakedsvg.svg"/>


** Automatic Failover

- The replica set *cannot process write operations* until the election completes successfully.

- The replica set can *continue to serve read queries* while the primary is offline.

- Application connection logic should include tolerance for automatic failovers and the subsequent elections.


** 选举

Replica sets can trigger an election in response to a variety of events, such as:

- Adding a new node to the replica set.
- Initiating a replica set.
- Performing replica set maintenance using methods such as =rs.stepDown()= or =rs.reconfig()=.
- Secondary members losing connectivity to the primary for more than the configured timeout (10 seconds by default).


*** Member Priority

Secondaries with higher priority call elections relatively *sooner* than secondaries with lower priority, and are also *more likely to win*.

Members with a priority value of =0= cannot become primary and do not seek election.


*** 网络分区

When the primary detects that it can only see a *minority* of nodes in the replica set, the primary steps down and _becomes a secondary_. \\
A member in the partition that can communicate with a *majority* of the nodes (including itself) _holds an election to become the new primary_.



** Rollback

- A rollback is necessary *only if* the primary had accepted write operations that the secondaries had not successfully replicated before the primary stepped down.
- MongoDB attempts to avoid rollbacks.
- A rollback does not occur if the write operations replicate to another member of the replica set before the primary steps down.
- To prevent rollbacks of data that have been acknowledged to the client, run all voting members *with journaling enabled* and use =w: majority= write concern.

** [[https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-write-concern/][Write Concern]]

Write concern for replica sets describe the *number* of data-bearing members that must acknowledge a write operation before the operation returns as successful. \\
A member can only acknowledge a write operation after it has received and applied the write successfully.

For replica sets, the default write concern of =w: 1= requires that only the primary replica set member acknowledge the write before returning write concern acknowledgment.


*** w: majority

#+HTML: <img src="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/_images/crud-write-concern-w-majority.bakedsvg.svg"/>

With =writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault= set to false, MongoDB does not wait for =w: majority= writes to be written to the on-disk journal before acknowledging the writes. \\
As such, majority write operations could possibly roll back in the event of a transient loss (e.g. crash and restart) of a majority of nodes in a given replica set.

** Read Preference

Read preference describes how MongoDB clients *route* read operations to the members of a replica set.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  By default, an application directs its read operations to the primary member in a replica set.
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Sharding

MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding.

MongoDB sharded cluster consists of the following components:

- shard: Each shard contains a subset of the sharded data. Each shard can be deployed as a replica set.
- mongos: The mongos acts as a query router, providing an interface between client applications and the sharded cluster.
- config servers: Config servers store metadata and configuration settings for the cluster.

#+HTML: <img src="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/_images/sharded-cluster-production-architecture.bakedsvg.svg"/>

You must connect to a mongos router to interact with any collection in the sharded cluster.
This includes sharded and unsharded collections.
*Clients should never connect to a single shard in order to perform read or write operations.*
