* Resources

** Pod


*** YAML Definition

定义文件主要包含：

1. API version
2. Resource type
3. Metadata \\
   Includes the name, namespace, labels, and other information about the pod.
4. Spec \\
   Contains the actual description of the pod’s contents, such as the pod’s con- tainers, volumes, and other data.
5. Status\\
   Contains read-only runtime data that shows the state of the resource at a given moment.\\
   *When creating a new pod, you never need to provide the status part.*


[[file:img/k8s_pod_def.png]]


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  在 POD 定义文件中定义 ports 是可选的行为，端口始终可以被访问，主要是为了方便用户清楚的了解提供了哪些服务。
#+END_EXAMPLE



*** Label

A label is an arbitrary key-value pair you attach to a resource, \\
which is then utilized when selecting resources using *label selectors* \\
(resources are filtered based on whether they include the label specified in the selector).

[[file:img/k8s_labels.png]]

A label selector can select resources based on whether the resource:

1. Contains (or doesn’t contain) a label with a certain key \\
2. Contains a label with a certain key and value \\
3. Contains a label with a certain key, but with a value not equal to the one you specify


*** Annotation

Annotations are also key-value pairs, so in essence, they’re similar to labels,
but they aren’t meant to hold identifying information.

They can’t be used to group objects the way labels can.
While objects can be selected through label selectors, *there’s no such thing as an annotation selector.*

Annotations can hold much larger pieces of information (up to 256 KB in total) and are primarily *meant to be used by tools.*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Annotations are also commonly used when introducing new features to Kubernetes.
  Usually, alpha and beta versions of new features don’t introduce any new fields to API objects.
  Annotations are used instead of fields, and then once the required API changes have become clear and been agreed upon by the Kubernetes developers, new fields are introduced and the related annotations deprecated.

  A great use of annotations is adding descriptions for each pod or other API object, so that everyone using the cluster can quickly look up information about each individual object.
  For example, an annotation used to specify the name of the person who created the object can make collaboration between everyone working on the cluster much easier.
#+END_EXAMPLE


*** Deleting

By deleting a pod, you’re instructing Kubernetes to terminate all the containers that are part of that pod.

Kubernetes sends a *SIGTERM* signal to the process and waits a certain number of seconds (30 by default) for it to shut down gracefully.

If it doesn’t shut down in time, the process is then killed through *SIGKILL*.
To make sure your processes are always shut down gracefully, they need to handle the SIGTERM signal properly.


*** Liveness probes

As soon as a pod is scheduled to a node, the Kubelet on that node will run its containers and, from then on, *keep them running as long as the pod exists.*

If the container’s main process crashes, *the Kubelet will restart the container.*

Kubernetes can check if a *container* is still alive through =liveness probes=.

You can specify a liveness probe for each container in the pod’s specification.
Kubernetes will periodically execute the probe and restart the container if the probe fails.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Kubernetes also supports readiness probes. Be sure not to confuse the two. They’re used for two different things.
#+END_EXAMPLE


[[file:img/k8s_pod_liveness.png]]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Liveness:       http-get http://:8080/ delay=0s timeout=1s period=10s #success=1 #failure=3

  The delay=0s part shows that the probing begins immediately after the container is started.
  If you don’t set the initial delay, the prober will start probing the container as soon as it starts,
  which usually leads to the probe failing, because the app isn’t ready to start receiving requests.

  The timeout is set to only 1 second, so the container must return a response in 1 second or the probe is counted as failed.

  The container is probed every 10 seconds (period=10s) and the container is restarted after the probe fails three consecutive times (#failure=3).
#+END_EXAMPLE


** ReplicationController

A ReplicationController’s job is to make sure that an exact number of pods always *matches its label selector.* \\
If it doesn’t, the ReplicationController takes the appropriate action to reconcile the actual with the desired number.

[[file:img/k8s_rc_loop.png]]


*** Three Parts Of A Replicationcontroller

[[file:img/k8s_rc_3parts.png]]


A ReplicationController’s replica count, the label selector, and even the pod template can all be modified at any time,
*but only changes to the replica count affect existing pods.*


*** Create

[[file:img/k8s_rc_def.png]]

The pod labels in the template must obviously match the label selector of the ReplicationController;
otherwise the controller would create new pods indefinitely, because spinning up a new pod wouldn’t bring the actual replica count any closer to the desired number of replicas.

To prevent such scenarios, the API server verifies the ReplicationController definition and will not accept it if it’s misconfigured.
*Not specifying the selector at all is also an option.* In that case, it will be configured automatically from the labels in the pod template.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Don’t specify a pod selector when defining a ReplicationController.
  Let Kubernetes extract it from the pod template. This will keep your YAML shorter and simpler.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Although a pod isn’t tied to a ReplicationController, the pod does reference it in the =metadata.ownerReferences= field, \\
which you can use to easily find which ReplicationController a pod belongs to.


*** Change Pod Template

A ReplicationController’s pod template can be modified at any time. \\
Changing the pod template is like replacing a cookie cutter with another one. \\
It will only affect the cookies you cut out afterward and will have no effect on the ones you’ve already cut. \\
To modify the old pods, you’d need to delete them and let the ReplicationController replace them with new ones based on the new template.

[[file:img/k8s_rc_change_pod_tmpl.png]]


*** Deleting a ReplicationController Without Deleting Pods

When you delete a ReplicationController through kubectl delete, the pods are also deleted.\\
But because pods created by a ReplicationController aren’t an integral part of the ReplicationController, and are only managed by it, \\
*you can delete only the ReplicationController and leave the pods running:*

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  kubectl delete rc <rc-name> --cascade=false
#+END_SRC


** ReplicaSet

You usually won’t create them directly, but instead have them created automatically *when you create the higher-level Deployment resource.*

A ReplicaSet behaves exactly like a ReplicationController, but it has *more expressive pod selectors.*

*** More Expressive Label Selectors

[[file:img/k8s_rs_label_selector.png]]

Each expression must contain _a key_, _an operator_, and possibly (depending on the operator) _a list of values_. \\
Four valid operators:

+ In :: Label’s value must match one of the specified _values_.
+ NotIn :: Label’s value must not match any of the specified _values_.
+ Exists :: Pod must include a label with the specified key (the value isn’t important). When using this operator, you shouldn’t specify the _values_ field.
+ DoesNotExist :: Pod must not include a label with the specified key. The _values_ property must not be specified.


** DaemonSet

DaemonSet is used when you want *a pod to run on each and every node in the cluster* \\
(and each node needs to run exactly *one instance of the pod*).

[[file:img/k8s_ds.png]]

To run a pod on all cluster nodes, you create a DaemonSet object, which is much like a ReplicationController or a ReplicaSet, \\
except that pods created by a DaemonSet already have a target node specified and *skip the Kubernetes Scheduler.*


** Job

*In the event of a node failure*, the pods on that node that are managed by a Job will be rescheduled to other nodes the way ReplicaSet pods are. \\
*In the event of a failure of the process itself* (when the process returns an error exit code), \\
the Job can be configured to either restart the container or not.


*** Definition

[[file:img/k8s_job_def.png]]


Job pods can't use the default policy, because they're not meant to run indefinitely. \\
Need to explicitly set the restart policy to either =OnFailure= or =Never=.


*** Limiting the time allowed for a Job pod to complete

A pod's time can be limited by setting the =activeDeadlineSeconds= property in the pod spec. \\
If the pod runs longer than that, the system will try to terminate it and will mark the Job as failed.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  You can configure how many times a Job can be retried before it is marked as failed by specifying the spec.backoffLimit field in the Job manifest.
  If you don't explicitly specify it, it defaults to 6.
#+END_EXAMPLE



** CronJob

A CronJob creates Job resources from the =jobTemplate= property configured in the CronJob spec. \\
The Job then creates the pods.


** Service

*** Overall

Although the primary purpose of services is exposing groups of pods to other pods *in the cluster*, \\
*Both* internal (by DNS or ENV) and external (by IP) clients usually connect to pods through services:

[[file:img/k8s_svc_overall.png]]

*Label selectors* determine which pods belong to the Service:

[[file:img/k8s_svc_label.png]]


*** Creation

**** By =kubectl expose=


**** By YAML

[[file:img/k8s_svc_def.png]]

***** Exposing Multiple Ports In The Same Service

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  When creating a service with multiple ports, you must specify a name for each port.
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kubia
spec: ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443
  selector:
    app: kubia
#+END_SRC


***** Using Named Ports

[[file:img/k8s_svc_named_ports_container.png]]

You can then refer to those ports by name in the service spec:

[[file:img/k8s_svc_named_ports_pod.png]]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  The biggest benefit of doing so is that it enables you to change port numbers later without having to change the service spec.
#+END_EXAMPLE





*** Session Affinity

If you want all requests made by a certain client to be redirected to the *same* pod every time, \\
you can set the service's _sessionAffinity_ property to =ClientIP= (instead of =None=, which is the default).

This makes the service proxy redirect all requests originating *from the same client IP to the same pod.*


#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  spec:
    sessionAffinity: ClientIP
  ...
#+END_SRC





*** Discovering Service

**** Through ENV

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Dashes in the service name are converted to underscores and all letters are uppercased
  when the service name is used as the prefix in the environment variable's name.
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Through DNS

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  kubia        .default  .svc.cluster.local
  ------------
  service name
               ---------
               namespace
                         ------------------
                         configurable cluster domain suffix
#+END_EXAMPLE

*You can omit the =svc.cluster.local= suffix and even the namespace, when pods are in the same namespace.* \\
(This is because how =/etc/resolv.conf= is configured)


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Whether a pod uses the internal DNS server or not is configurable through the 'dnsPolicy' property in each pod's spec.
#+END_EXAMPLE


*** Endpoints

Services don't link to pods directly, but *Endpoints*. \\
An Endpoints resource (plural) is *a list of IP addresses and ports* exposing a service.

[[file:img/k8s_svc_endpoints.png]]


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Although the pod selector is defined in the service spec, it's not used directly when redirecting incoming connections.
  Instead, the selector is used to build a list of IPs and ports, which is then stored in the Endpoints resource.

  If you create a service without a pod selector, Kubernetes won't even create the Endpoints resource
  (after all, without a selector, it can't know which pods to include in the service).
  It's up to you to create the Endpoints resource to specify the list of endpoints for the service.
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Manually configuring service endpoints

To create a service with manually managed endpoints, you need to create both a Service and an Endpoints resource.

Define a service called external-service that will accept incoming connections on port 80 (didn't define a pod selector for the service):

[[file:img/k8s_svc_manual_ep_svc.png]]


The Endpoints object needs to *have the same name as the service* and contain the list of target IP addresses and ports for the service:

[[file:img/k8s_svc_manual_ep_ep.png]]

After both the Service and the Endpoints resource are posted to the server, \\
the service is ready to be used like any regular service with a pod selector:

[[file:img/k8s_svc_manual_ep_external.png]]

If you later decide to migrate the external service to pods running inside Kubernetes, \\
you can add a selector to the service, thereby making its Endpoints managed automatically.
The same is also true in reverse by removing the selector from a Service, Kubernetes stops updating its Endpoints. \\
This means a service IP address can remain constant while the actual implementation of the service is changed.





**** Creating an alias for an external service

[[file:img/k8s_svc_external_name.png]]

After the service is created, pods can connect to the external service through the =external-service.default.svc.cluster.local= domain name.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ExternalName services are implemented solely at the DNS level: a simple CNAME DNS record is created for the service.
  Therefore, clients connecting to the service will connect to the external service directly, bypassing the service proxy completely.
  For this reason, these types of services don't even get a cluster IP.
#+END_EXAMPLE



*** Exposing Services To External Clients

A few ways to make a service accessible externally:

1. Setting the service type to NodePort
2. Setting the service type to LoadBalancer, an extension of the NodePort type
3. Creating an Ingress resource

**** NodePort

[[file:img/k8s_svc_node_port_overall.png]]

An incoming connection to one of those ports will be redirected to a randomly selected pod, \\
which may or may not be the one running on the node the connection is being made to.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  If you only point your clients to the first node, when that node fails, your clients can't access the service anymore.
  That's why it makes sense to put a load balancer in front of the nodes to make sure you're spreading requests across all healthy nodes and never sending them to a node that's offline at that moment.
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** YAML Definition

[[file:img/k8s_svc_node_port_def.png]]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Specifying the port isn't mandatory; Kubernetes will choose a random port if you omit it.
#+END_EXAMPLE



**** LoadBalancer

Kubernetes clusters running on cloud providers usually support the automatic provision of a load balancer from the cloud infrastructure. \\
The load balancer will have its own unique, publicly accessible IP address and will redirect all connections to your service. \\
You can thus access your service through the load balancer's IP address.

If Kubernetes is running in an environment that doesn't support LoadBalancer services, \\
the load balancer will not be provisioned, but the service will still behave like a NodePort service. \\
That's because *a LoadBalancer service is an extension of a NodePort service.* \\
(LoadBalancer type service is still a NodePort service but with an additional infrastructure-provided load balancer)


[[file:img/k8s_svc_lb_overall.png]]


***** YAML Definition

[[file:img/k8s_svc_lb_def.png]]


**** Ingress

One important reason is that each LoadBalancer service requires its own load balancer with its own public IP address, \\
whereas an Ingress *only requires one*, even when providing access to dozens of services.

Ingresses operate at the application layer of the network stack (HTTP) and can provide features such as cookie-based session affinity and the like, \\
which services can’t.


[[file:img/k8s_svc_ingress_overall.png]]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Ingress controller provisions a load balancer behind the scenes.
#+END_EXAMPLE


***** YAML Definition

[[file:img/k8s_svc_ingress_def.png]]

[[file:img/k8s_svc_ingress_process.png]]


Ingress controller didn’t forward the request to the service. *It only used it to select a pod*. (Most controllers work like this)



*** Readiness Probe

Kubernetes invokes the probe periodically and acts based on the result of the readiness probe. \\
If a pod reports that it’s not ready, it’s removed from the service. If the pod then becomes ready again, it’s re-added.

Unlike liveness probes, if a container fails the readiness check, it won’t be killed or restarted. \\
The effect is the same as when the pod doesn’t match the service’s label selector at all:

[[file:img/k8s_svc_readiness_probe.png]]


*** Headless

Kubernetes allows clients to *discover pod IPs* through DNS lookups. \\
Usually, when you perform a DNS lookup for a service, the DNS server returns a single IP (the service’s cluster IP). \\
By setting the =clusterIP= field to =None= in the service specification, the DNS server will return the pod IPs instead of the single service IP.

Instead of returning a single DNS A record, the DNS server will return multiple A records for the service, \\
each pointing to the IP of an individual pod backing the service at that moment.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  A headless services still provides load balancing across pods,
  but through the DNS round-robin mechanism instead of through the service proxy.
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** External Traffic Issure

When an external client connects to a service through the node port (this also includes cases when it goes through the load balancer first), \\
the randomly chosen pod may or may not be running on the same node that received the connection. \\
An additional network hop is required to reach the pod, but this may not always be desirable.

You can prevent this additional hop by configuring the service to redirect external traffic only to pods running on the node that received the connection. \\
This is done by setting the =externalTrafficPolicy= field in the service's spec section:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  spec:
    externalTrafficPolicy: Local
    ...
#+END_SRC

f a service definition includes this setting and an external connection is opened through the service's node port, \\
the service proxy will choose a locally running pod. If no local pods exist, the connection will *hang*. \\
You therefore need to ensure the load balancer forwards connections only to nodes that *have at least one such pod*.

**** Non-Preservation Of The Client's IP Issue

Usually, when clients inside the cluster connect to a service, the pods backing the service *can obtain the client's IP address*. \\
But when the connection is received through a node port, the packets' *source IP is changed*, because SNAT is performed on the packets.

The _Local_ external traffic policy (externalTrafficPolicy: Local) described in the previous section affects the preservation of the client's IP, \\
because there's no additional hop between the node receiving the connection and the node hosting the target pod (*SNAT isn't performed*).


* Internals

** Container Vs VM

[[file:img/k8s_container_vs_vm.png]]

file:img/k8s_container_vs_vm_cpu.png


** K8S components

[[file:img/k8s_components.png]]







































** Volume

Volumes aren't top-level resources like pods, but are instead defined as a part of a pod and *share the same lifecycle as the pod.* \\
This means _a volume is created when the pod is started and is destroyed when the pod is deleted._

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Kubernetes volumes are a component of a pod and are thus defined in the pod's specification-much like containers.
  They aren't a standalone Kubernetes object and can not be created or deleted on their own.
#+END_EXAMPLE


*** Volume Types

- emptyDir :: A simple empty directory used for storing transient data.
- hostPath :: Used for mounting directories from the worker node's filesystem into the pod.
- gitRepo :: A volume initialized by checking out the contents of a Git repository.
- nfs :: An NFS share mounted into the pod.
- gcePersistentDisk, awsElasticBlockStore, azureDisk :: Cloud provider.
- cinder, cephfs, iscsi, flocker, glusterfs, quobyte, rbd, flexVolume, vsphere- Volume, photonPersistentDisk, scaleIO :: Network storage.
- onfigMap, secret, downwardAPI
- persistentVolumeClaim

*** =emptyDir= Volume

An =emptyDir= volume is especially useful for sharing files between containers running in the same pod.

An =emptyDir= volume is the simplest type of volume, but *other types build upon it*. \\
(After the empty directory is created, they then populate it with data)

**** The medium used

The =emptyDir= used as the volume was created on the actual disk of the worker node hosting the pod. \\
Kubernetes can create the =emptyDir= on a tmpfs filesystem (in memory instead of on disk). \\
To do this, set the =emptyDir='s medium to =Memory=:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  volumes:
    - name: html
      emptyDir:
        medium: Memory
#+END_SRC











* YAML

[[https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9354-kubernetes-and-openshift-resource-support][IDEA Kubernetes YAML 插件]]

** Key Value Pair

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  fruit: apple
  vegetable: carrot
  liquid: water
  meat: chicken
#+END_SRC


** Array / List

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  fruits:
    - orange
    - apple
    - banana

  vegetables:
    - carrot
    - cauliflower
    - tomato
#+END_SRC


** Dictionary / Map

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  banana:
    calories: 105
    fat: 0.4
    carbs: 27

  grape:
    calories: 62
    fat: 0.3
    carbs: 16
#+END_SRC



* 核心原理

** 资源对象

*** POD

**** 基本 YAML 定义



*apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec 是必填项*

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: nginx
    labels:
      app: nginx
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      ports:
      - containerPort: 80
#+END_SRC






#+BEGIN_SRC sh
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
#+END_SRC



**** 设计理念

Pod 是在 K8s 集群中运行部署应用或服务的最小单元，它是可以支持多容器的。

Pod 的设计理念是支持多个容器在一个 Pod 中共享网络地址和文件系统，可以通过进程间通信和文件共享这种简单高效的方式组合完成服务。

Pod 是 K8s 集群中所有业务类型的基础，不同类型的业务就需要不同类型的 *控制器* 去执行。

目前 K8s 中的业务主要可以分为：

- 长期伺服型 (long-running)
- 批处理型 (batch)
- 节点后台支撑型 (node-daemon)
- 有状态应用型 (stateful application)

分别对应的控制器类型为：

- Deployment
- Job
- DaemonSet
- StatefulSet

直接创建的 Pod 一旦被调度后就跟 Node 绑定，即使 Node 挂掉也不会被重新调度（ *而是被自动删除* ），因此推荐使用 Deployment、Daemonset 等控制器来容错。



**** 生命周期

- Pending :: Pod 已经在 apiserver 中创建，但还没有调度到 Node 上面
- Running :: Pod 已经调度到 Node 上面，所有容器都已经创建，并且至少有一个容器还在运行或者正在启动
- Succeeded :: Pod 调度到 Node 上面后成功运行结束，并且不会重启
- Failed :: Pod 调度到 Node 上面后至少有一个容器运行失败（即退出码不为 0 或者被系统终止）
- Unknonwn :: 状态未知，通常是由于 apiserver 无法与 kubelet 通信导致



**** 重启策略(restartPolicy)

PodSpec 中的 =restartPolicy= 可以用来设置是否对退出的 Pod 重启，可选项包括:

- Always :: 只要退出就重启
- OnFailure :: 失败退出（exit code 不等于 0）时重启
- Never :: 只要退出就不再重启

*注意，这里的重启是指在 Pod 所在 Node 上面本地重启，并不会调度到其他 Node 上去。*

- 单容器的 Pod ，容器成功退出时，不同 restartPolicy 时的动作为
  - Always: 重启 Container; Pod phase 保持 Running.
  - OnFailure: Pod phase 变成 Succeeded.
  - Never: Pod phase 变成 Succeeded.

- 单容器的 Pod ，容器失败退出时，不同 restartPolicy 时的动作为
  - Always: 重启 Container; Pod phase 保持 Running.
  - OnFailure: 重启 Container; Pod phase 保持 Running.
  - Never: Pod phase 变成 Failed.

- 2 个容器的 Pod，其中一个容器在运行而另一个失败退出时，不同 restartPolicy 时的动作为
  - Always: 重启 Container; Pod phase 保持 Running.
  - OnFailure: 重启 Container; Pod phase 保持 Running.
  - Never: 不重启 Container; Pod phase 保持 Running.

- 2 个容器的 Pod，其中一个容器停止而另一个失败退出时，不同 restartPolicy 时的动作为
  - Always: 重启 Container; Pod phase 保持 Running.
  - OnFailure: 重启 Container; Pod phase 保持 Running.
  - Never: Pod phase 变成 Failed.

- 单容器的 Pod，容器内存不足（OOM），不同 restartPolicy 时的动作为
  - Always: 重启 Container; Pod phase 保持 Running.
  - OnFailure: 重启 Container; Pod phase 保持 Running.
  - Never: 记录失败事件; Pod phase 变成 Failed.

其他情况的处理逻辑：

- Pod 还在运行，但磁盘不可访问时
  1. 终止所有容器
  2. Pod phase 变成 Failed
  3. 如果 Pod 是由某个控制器管理的，则重新创建一个 Pod 并调度到其他 Node 运行

- Pod 还在运行，但由于网络分区故障导致 Node 无法访问
  1. Node controller等待 Node 事件超时
  2. Node controller 将 Pod phase 设置为 Failed.
  3. 如果 Pod 是由某个控制器管理的，则重新创建一个 Pod 并调度到其他 Node 运行




**** 使用 Volume

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: redis
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: redis
      image: redis
      volumeMounts:
      - name: redis-storage
        mountPath: /data/redis
    volumes:
    - name: redis-storage
      emptyDir: {}

#+END_SRC



**** 环境变量

Pod 的名字、命名空间、IP 以及容器的计算资源限制等可以通过 [[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/][Downward API]] 的方式获取并存储到环境变量中。



**** 镜像拉取策略(ImagePullPolicy)

支持三种 =ImagePullPolicy=:

- Always :: 不管镜像是否存在都会进行一次拉取
- Never :: 不管镜像是否存在都不会进行拉取
- IfNotPresent :: 只有镜像不存在时，才会进行镜像拉取

*注意：*

默认为 =IfNotPresent= ，但 :latest 标签的镜像默认为 =Always= 。

拉取镜像时 docker 会进行校验，如果镜像中的 MD5 码没有变，则不会拉取镜像数据。

生产环境中应该尽量避免使用 :latest 标签，而开发环境中可以借助 :latest 标签自动拉取最新的镜像。


**** DNS 策略

通过设置 =dnsPolicy= 参数，设置 Pod 中容器访问 DNS 的策略：

- ClusterFirst :: 优先基于 cluster domain （如 default.svc.cluster.local） 后缀，通过 kube-dns 查询 (默认策略)
- Default :: 优先从 Node 中配置的 DNS 查询


**** Health Probe

为了确保容器在部署后确实处在正常运行状态，Kubernetes 提供了两种探针（Probe）来探测容器的状态：

- LivenessProbe :: 探测应用是否处于健康状态，如果不健康则删除并重新创建容器
- ReadinessProbe :: 探测应用是否启动完成并且处于正常服务状态，如果不正常则不会接收来自 Kubernetes Service 的流量

Kubernetes 支持三种方式来执行探针：

- exec :: 在容器中执行一个命令，如果 命令退出码 返回 0 则表示探测成功，否则表示失败
- tcpSocket :: 对指定的容器 IP 及端口执行一个 TCP 检查，如果端口是开放的则表示探测成功，否则表示失败
- httpGet :: 对指定的容器 IP、端口及路径执行一个 HTTP Get 请求，如果返回的 状态码 在 [200,400) 之间则表示探测成功，否则表示失败

**** 调度到指定 Node 上

可以通过 =nodeSelector=, =nodeAffinity=, =podAffinity= 以及 =Taints= 和 =tolerations= 等来将 Pod 调度到需要的 Node 上。

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: nginx
    labels:
      env: test
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    nodeSelector:
      <label>: <value>
#+END_EXAMPLE


**** 常用命令

***** 查看 Pod 状态

=kubectl get pod <pod_name> -o jsonpath="{.status.phase}"=




*** Replica Set

ReplicaSet 跟 ReplicationController 没有本质的不同，只是名字不一样，
并且 ReplicaSet 支持集合式的 selector（ReplicationController 仅支持等式）。

Deployment 使用了 Replica Set ，是更高一层的概念。
除非需要自定义升级功能或根本不需要升级 Pod ，一般情况下，推荐使用 Deployment 而不直接使用 Replica Set 。
这样就无需担心跟其他机制的不兼容问题（比如 ReplicaSet 不支持 rolling-update 但 Deployment 支持），
并且还支持版本记录、回滚、暂停升级等高级特性。


**** YAML 定义

=spec.template= 可以从 Pod 定义文件中复制过来：

[[file:img/k8s_replica-set-tmpl.png]]


**** 常用命令

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
kubectl replace -f rs-def.yml
kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f rs-def.yml
kubectl scale --replicas=6 replicaset <name>
#+END_SRC


* Utils

** Bash completion

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  source <(kubectl completion bash | sed s/kubectl/<your_alias>/g)
#+END_SRC


** Show all resources

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  kubectl get
#+END_SRC

** Discover possible API object fields

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  kubectl explain pods
#+END_SRC

You can then drill deeper to find out more about each attribute.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  kubectl explain pod.spec
#+END_SRC

** Quickly switch to a different namespace

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  alias kcd='kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current- context) --namespace '
#+END_SRC

You can then switch between namespaces using =kcd <some-namespace>=

** Forwarding a local network port to a port in the pod

Using port forwarding like this is an effective way to test an individual pod.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  kubectl port-forward <pod-name> <local-port>:<pod-port>
#+END_SRC


** Obtaining the application log of a crashed container

You can print the application’s log with kubectl logs. If your container is restarted, the kubectl logs command will show the log of the current container.

When you want to figure out why the previous container terminated, you’ll want to see those logs instead of the current container’s logs.
This can be done by using the =--previous= option:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  kubectl logs <pod> --previous
#+END_SRC

** Get IPs of all nodes

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type=="ExternalIP")].address}'
#+END_SRC
